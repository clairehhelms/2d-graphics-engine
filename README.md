## This 2D Graphics Engine
was built during a semester-long course at UNC Chapel Hill based off the Skia graphics engine and under the instruction of Mike Reed.

To use the engine to create a set of images, run:
```
make image
./image -e expected -v
open diff/index.html
```

You can also run unit tests:
```
make tests
./tests -v
```
